# Programming Languages

Just print "ISSUES"

Example in JS (On browser / Node):
```js
console.log('ISSUES')
```

# Data Serialization Languages (Includes languages like YAML.)
Make "say" property to "ISSUES"

# Non-Programming Languages (Something like HTML, Except languages like XML)

Just make returning "ISSUES"
